# TigerJython

TigerJython is an educational development environment for Python with enhanced error messages.  It runs on the Java Virtual Machine and already includes [Jython](https://www.jython.org/).  The [JAR-file](release/TigerJython3.jar) therefore already contains everything you need.

> This is an early access version that is not yet ready for classroom use.
